		<div class="description">
			SpecsFor is a light-weight Behavior-Driven Development framework that focuses on
			ease of use for <u>developers</u> by minimizing testing friction.
		</div>
		<p>
			It is an opinionated (but flexible) testing framework built on top of NUnit. While
			NUnit and similar frameworks provide the barebone essentials for creating tests,
			they don't address many of the other arduous tasks involved in Test Driven Development.
			That's where SpecsFor comes in.  
		</p>
		<p>
			Simply add the SpecsFor NuGet package to your project,
			and you will immediately have access to a the SpecsFor BDD-style testing framework as 
			well as other essential testing tools, such as Moq, ExpectedObjects, and Should. 
		</p>
		<h2>Install</h2>
		<p>
			The easiest way to get started with SpecsFor is to install it with NuGet.</p>
		<div class="commandWrapper">
			<div class="commandPrompt">
				<p class="command">
					PM&gt; Install-Package SpecsFor</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<p>
			Binary packages are also available on the Github project page. 
		</p>
		<h2>Examples</h2>
		<p>
			SpecsFor can be easily tailored to how you want to write tests.  You can keep it old-school
			and skip the BDD-style syntax:
		</p>
		<script src="https://gist.github.com/1375611.js?file=OrderProcessorSpecs.OldSchool.cs"></script>
		<p>
			If you are a more experienced tester who prefers the BDD-way and one-assert-per-test, you can separate your Given, When, and 
			Then steps.  SpecsFor will ensure that your Given and When are only run once no matter how 
			many Then's you have.
		</p>
		<script src="https://gist.github.com/1375611.js?file=OrderProcessingSpecs.BDD.cs"></script>
		<p>
			You can easily reuse context across test fixtures in a variety of ways.  There's the 
			typical inheritance-based approach:
		</p>
		<script src="https://gist.github.com/1375611.js?file=OrderProcessingSpecs.BDD.Inheritance.cs"></script>
		<p>
			If you prefer a more composable approach, you can separate your context out and apply
			one or more Givens in a fixture:
		</p>
		<script src="https://gist.github.com/1375611.js?file=ValidatingOrderProcessorSpecs.Compositional.cs"></script>
		<p>
			If your When and Then steps are constant, but you need to evaluate them across a variety
			of Given contexts, you can take advantage of the attribute-based approach, and your
			fixture will be executed multiple times, once for each attribute:
		</p>
		<script src="https://gist.github.com/1375611.js?file=ValidatingOrderProcessorSpecs.Attributes.cs"></script>
		<h2>Additional Test Helpers</h2>
		<p>
			Aside from the core SpecsFor base class, there are several other helpers that will simplify
			your tests, clean up your code, and boost your productivity.  Have you ever needed to verify
			that a complex object was passed to a mock object?  Or verify multiple properties on a returned object?
			If so, you probably ended up with code that looked something like:
		</p>
		<script src="https://gist.github.com/1375611.js?file=InvoiceProcessorSpecs.WithoutHelpers.cs"></script>
		<p>
			With SpecsFor's Looks.Like and ShouldLookLike methods, you can simplify the above code to:
		</p>
		<script src="https://gist.github.com/1375611.js?file=InvoiceProcessorSpecs.WithHelpers.cs"></script>
		<p>
			SpecsFor also includes both Resharper and Visual Studio templates that are designed to
			save you keystrokes while crafting your tests.  The included templates are meant to serve as 
			a starting point and are easily customizable.
